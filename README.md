# Widget Dashboard Application

## Overview

This project is a Widget Dashboard Application developed to manage and display various widgets in different categories. Users can add or remove widgets from the dashboard and customize their view. The application uses local storage for state management.

## Features

- **Dynamic Widget Management**: Add or remove widgets dynamically from different categories.
- **Local Storage**: Utilizes local storage to persist widget data and dashboard state.
- **Responsive Design**: Designed to be user-friendly and responsive across different devices.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd [repository-directory]
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

1. **Start the Development Server**

   Use the following command to start the application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Open Your Browser**

   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser to view the application.

### Local Storage

This application uses local storage to manage and persist the state of the widgets and categories. Local storage allows the application to save the current state across page reloads.

## Known Issues

- **Redux Integration**: The current implementation uses local storage instead of Redux for state management. While this approach works, the application could benefit from incorporating Redux for better state management and scalability.
- **Feature Improvements**: The application is a work in progress, and additional features and optimizations are planned for future updates.

## Personal Note

I wanted to mention that my nani recently passed away, and I have been out of town for this entire week. As a result, I completed this project in a few hours. I understand that the application could benefit from improvements, particularly in terms of Redux store and features, but I did my best given the circumstances. I have experience with similar projects in the past, but unfortunately, I couldn't push them due to unavoidable reasons.

Please consider me for the trainee position. I am committed to continuing to enhance this project and applying my skills to contribute effectively.

Thank you for your understanding.
